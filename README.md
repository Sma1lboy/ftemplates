# vite + react

vite + react

## Introduction

This project is a web frontend project template based on the Vite scaffolding with React framework. It includes custom Prettier and ESLint settings and uses SWC as the JavaScript/TypeScript compiler. This template aims to help developers quickly start a pre-configured React project, making the development process more efficient and unified.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that provides fast cold starts and instant hot module replacement (HMR).
- **SWC**: A high-performance JavaScript/TypeScript compiler that aims to be faster than Babel.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, helping to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that supports multiple languages, ensuring consistent code style.

## Quick Start

To start a new project using this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Template**

Use `degit` to clone the template to your local directory. `degit` allows you to quickly download templates without retaining the history, making the initialization of new projects lightweight.

```bash
npx degit sma1lboy/ftemplates#VERSION my-new-project
```

## Customizing Configuration

This template comes with a set of pre-configured Prettier and ESLint settings. You can adjust these configuration files according to personal or team coding practices.

- **Prettier Configuration**: `.prettierrc`
- **ESLint Configuration**: `.eslintrc.js`

Please refer to their respective documentation for guidance on customizing these tools' configurations.
